school project for hardware&amp;software solutions website

Made from scratch website built for a school project in the summer of 2015. Looking back to it, I might say some of the components used may be outdated or obsolete, but the basic functionality of the website works just fine.

It's not mobile-responsive because it was my first project ever and I wasn't aware of all screen sizes but in my following projects I have made mobile responsiveness a primary feature.

I used  HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end development and PHP for the contact form.
